# gb-rail-cli

This is a project with limited (but some real-world) functionality, as a means by which I can test out the new API and live data feeds provided by the Rail Delivery Group for developers regarding the NR RTT and WTT. To that end it is a baic comamnd line tool that allows certain filtering and selection options in order to quickly gather and easily display data about current rail movements all across England, Wales and Scotland, while doing so in a user-friendly way that can be easily read and interpreted.
